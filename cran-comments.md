# Resubmission 
This is a re-submission and I have fixed:  
* Package description no longer starts with "This package."  
* Added a URL for NOAA to the description file.  
* Explained all acronyms in the description file.   
* Replaced `\dontrun{}` with `\donttest{}` in all .Rd files.    

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.1, R 4.4.4 and devel
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
