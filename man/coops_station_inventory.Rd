\title{Gather Co-OPS Station Data History}
\usage{
coops_station_inventory(station_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{station_id}{is a character string that provides the a 7 character
station id.}
}
\value{
A data frame.
}
\description{
Find the historical data availability for a CO-OPS station.  This data is
obtained by scraping the data inventory page for the station. See the page for the
\href{https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/inventory.html?id=9761115}{Barbuda(station_id=9761115)}
as an example.
}
\details{
In the returned data frame each row represents a particular oceanographic or
meteorological measurement. The name of the measurement is provided in the first
column (\strong{Type}). The second column, \strong{From}, provides a timestamp
indicating the earliest available data for the measurement. The third column,
\strong{To}, provides the last date and time when the measurement is
available. When there are gaps in availability there will be two rows from
a given measurement. See the table below as an example.

\tabular{lcc}{
\strong{Type}  \tab  \strong{From}  \tab  \strong{To}  \cr
Wind  \tab  2011-06-10 21:06  \tab  2019-11-30 06:36  \cr
Air Temperature  \tab  2011-06-10 20:48  \tab  2019-11-30 06:36  \cr
Water Temperature  \tab  2011-06-10 20:48  \tab  2013-03-10 03:48  \cr
Water Temperature  \tab  2015-04-03 13:06  \tab  2019-11-30 06:36  \cr
}

As of the release of version 0.20.0 there are thirteen stations where the
data inventory is missing and an \strong{Error} will be returned if queried with
\code{coops_station_inventory()}.  The list of stations without a data
inventory can be accessed by calling \code{noaaoceans:::known_missing_inventory()}.
Due to heavy use of JavaScript on data inventory pages and a desire
to keep package dependencies to a minimum the list of known stations has been
hard coded. Please create an
\href{https://github.com/warlicks/noaaoceans/issues}{Issue} or
\href{https://github.com/warlicks/noaaoceans/pulls}{Pull Request} to update
the list stations missing data inventory.
